# Indebted Take Home Exercise â€“ Message Scheduling

## Provided Information 
### Question
What time of day and day of week should we send messages to our customers to encourage them to clear their debt to the best of their capacities?

### Notes
The actual accuracy of the final model is not the key focus. We are trying to assess the methodologies you have applied to address the problem statement and ultimately arrive at your recommendations. The key aspects we are looking for can be summarised as:
1. Demonstrate a clear understanding of how to analyse a data set
2. Create a clear methodology to produce the recommendations for the sample set
3. Is the process reproducible for the purpose of future recommendations?
4. A concise explanation of how to run the process
